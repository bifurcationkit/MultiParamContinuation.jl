In this tutorial, we show how to cover a plane as solution of

$$F(u) := u_3 = 0$$


We use this model as a mean to introduce the basics of `MultiParamContinuation.jl`.

It is easy to encode the manifold as follows

```@example TUTODE0
using CairoMakie, MultiParamContinuation
const MPC = MultiParamContinuation

F(u,p) = [u[3]]

prob = ManifoldProblem(F, [.0,0.,0.], nothing;
                        # we pass a function to provide the tangent space
                        # with an analytical formula
                        get_tangent = (u,p) -> [1 0; 0 1; 0 0],
                        # restrict computations to hypercube    
                        finalize_solution = Cube(0.5)
                        )
```

```@example TUTODE0
show(prob)
```

We now compute a covering of the manifold.

```@example TUTODE0
S = MPC.continuation(prob,
            Henderson(np0 = 4),
            CoveringPar(max_charts = 20000, 
                    max_steps = 100,
                    verbose = 0,
                    R0 = .1,
                    ))
show(S)
```

You plot the result as follows

```@example TUTODE0
MPC.plotd(S; 
    draw_tangent = true, 
    plot_center = true,
    draw_edges = true,
    )
```

It is sometimes useful to have access to more information, and for example plot in 2d:

```@example TUTODE0
MPC.plot2d(S; 
    draw_circle = true,
    plot_center = true,
    put_ids = true,
    ind_plot = [1,2])
```
