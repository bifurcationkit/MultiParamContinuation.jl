# Tutorials

```

The tutorials are rated by the following scale of difficulty

1. 🟢 basic knowledge of (numerical) bifurcation theory (following equilibria / periodic orbits)
2. 🟡 advanced knowledge of (numerical) bifurcation theory (codim 2 bifurcations of equilibria)
2. 🟠 high level of knowledge of (numerical) bifurcation theory (codim 2 bifurcations of periodic orbits, tweaking the methods)
2. 🟤 very advanced tutorial, research level

## Small dimension examples

## Examples based on BifurcationKit

This tutorial relies on a `BifurcationProblem` to define a sphere, similarly to the above examples.

```@contents
Pages = ["ode/sphereBK.md"]

```

In this tutorial, we continue the equilibrium as function of to free parameters:

```@contents
Pages = ["ode/abc.md"]
