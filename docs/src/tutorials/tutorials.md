The tutorials are rated by the following scale of difficulty

1. ðŸŸ¢ basic knowledge of (numerical) bifurcation theory (following equilibria / periodic orbits)
2. ðŸŸ¡ advanced knowledge of (numerical) bifurcation theory (codim 2 bifurcations of equilibria)
2. ðŸŸ  high level of knowledge of (numerical) bifurcation theory (codim 2 bifurcations of periodic orbits, tweaking the methods)
2. ðŸŸ¤ very advanced tutorial, research level
